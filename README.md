💡 Simple Interest Calculator — GitHub Final Project(EDX)
A command-line calculator that computes Simple Interest based on user input for:
P → Principal amount
T → Time period (in years)
R → Annual rate of interest

🧮 Formula Used:
Simple Interest = (P × T × R) / 100

✅ Features:
Takes input from the Linux shell (interactive CLI)
Demonstrates basic shell scripting for input/output operations
A beginner-friendly project for understanding shell automation, arithmetic, and scripting

🎯 Learning Outcome:
This project helped me understand:
How Linux shell handles user input and displays output
Basics of bash scripting and command-line programming
Building interactive and utility-based CLI tools in a simple, modular way

🚀 Try it out:
bash simple_interest.sh
Input your principal, rate, and time — the script will return the calculated interest instantly.
