ðŸ’¡ Simple Interest Calculator â€” GitHub Final Project(EDX)

A command-line calculator that computes Simple Interest based on user input for:
P â†’ Principal amount
T â†’ Time period (in years)
R â†’ Annual rate of interest

ðŸ§® Formula Used:

Simple Interest = (P Ã— T Ã— R) / 100

âœ… Features:

Takes input from the Linux shell (interactive CLI)
Demonstrates basic shell scripting for input/output operations
A beginner-friendly project for understanding shell automation, arithmetic, and scripting

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcome:

This project helped me understand:
How Linux shell handles user input and displays output
Basics of bash scripting and command-line programming
Building interactive and utility-based CLI tools in a simple, modular way

ðŸš€ Try it out:

bash simple_interest.sh
Input your principal, rate, and time â€” the script will return the calculated interest instantly.

This project is useful for demonstarting the basic bash commands and gain a signinficant knowledge on Linux.
